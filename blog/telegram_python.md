# USING TELEGRAM FOR PYTHON
_Author: p-i-c-o_

## INTRO
_Telegrams' api gives hackers a new way to communicate with computers_

Telegrams' api has been used for many things, for example: Chat Bots, News and Updates, Content Delivery, and much much more. However, using Python and a small computer, a hacker can create a bot that can run malicious code.
Let's create one together.

### Installation
Because there are some issues with the current pip distribution of the python-telegram-bot, we need to install version 13.13 specifically:
`pip3 install python-telegram-bot==13.13`
