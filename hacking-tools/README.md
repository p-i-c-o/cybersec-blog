	<h1>Wifi Card:</h1>
	<p>The ALFA AWUS036ACH is a bang-for-your-buck wifi card. It works on both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, and interfaces with your devices over USB-C! With a 802.11ac chipset, it is the best option as a beginner card if you don't mind spending around 70$ on it. The card comes with 2 SMA connections, so you can attach any antennas you want! Personally I have the card permanently set up in my bag connected to a Pi, read about it on the bag section of this repo.</p>

	<h1>Primary Laptop:</h1>
	<p>My primary laptop is the 13-inch MacBook Pro from 2019, it works for all my coding and it has been holding up amazingly since I bought it! I did cheap out on the specs though: RAM: 8gb, Processor: 1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5, Storage: 256gb. I backup all my files on an external hard-drive, it's always a good idea to have a backup</p>
