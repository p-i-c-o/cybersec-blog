# Bag Stuff
This page is for everything in, on and for my bag.

## AP Hacking Rig
I have my Raspberry Pi Zero 2W connected to my WiFi card in my bag, they are both connected to a battery bank with a toggle button strapped to the side of my bag. As the two antennas are not joint (one is for 2.4GHz and the other for 5GHz), I sometimes spin my bag in order to get the best connection, but the size of the antenna usually gives me enough range for my tests and (legal) attacks. My bag is a MOLLE style bag, so the antennas just slip inside and are quite hidden, however the antennas sometimes slip down. So I designed and 3D printed a small mount for them. The antenna screws into the extension SMA cable, so I just put the mount in between. The mount is available [here](antenna_mount.stl)
